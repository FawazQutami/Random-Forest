    In information theory, the entropy of a random variable is the average level of "information", 
    "surprise", or "uncertainty" inherent in the variable's possible outcomes. 
    As an example, consider a biased coin with probability p of landing on heads and probability 1-p of 
    landing on tails. The maximum surprise is for p = 1/2, when there is no reason to expect one outcome 
    over another, and in this case a coin flip has an entropy of one bit. 
    The minimum surprise is when p = 0 or p = 1, when the event is known and the entropy is zero bits. 
    Other values of p give different entropies between zero and one bits.
    
    Given a discrete random variable X, with possible outcomes x1,..., xn, which occur with probability 
    P(x1),..., P(xn), the entropy of X is formally defined as:
            H(X) = - ∑i=1:n P(xi)log(P(xi))

    --> From Wikipedia
    Decision tree learning is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics,
    data mining and machine learning.
    It uses a decision tree (as a predictive model) to go from observations about an item
    (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in
    the leaves).
    Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification
    trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions
    of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take
    continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.
    Decision trees are among the most popular machine learning algorithms given their intelligibility
    and simplicity.

            A tree is built by splitting the source set, constituting the root node of the tree, 
            into subsets—which constitute the successor children. 
            The splitting is based on a set of splitting rules based on classification features.
            This process is repeated on each derived subset in a recursive manner called recursive partitioning. 
            The recursion is completed when the subset at a node has all the same values of the target variable, 
            or when splitting no longer adds value to the predictions. 
            This process of top-down induction of decision trees (TDIDT) is an example of a greedy algorithm,
            and it is by far the most common strategy for learning decision trees from data.
